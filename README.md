# Turbo search

This repo is a rails app implementing a sample product search using rails and hotwire.

This app is to illustrate [a blog post](https://dev.to/fredplante/a-powerful-search-feature-with-what-rails-provides-out-of-the-box-1oo8), inspired by [another blog post](https://dev.to/lso/the-ultimate-search-for-rails-episode-1-1mi) from [Louis Sommer](https://twitter.com/sommer_of_love) ([original repo](https://github.com/bear-in-mind/ultimate_search/tree/main))

To setup locally, ensure you have docker-compose installed, then run:

```bash
bin/setup
```
